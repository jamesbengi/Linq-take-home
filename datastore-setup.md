## Why I Chose MongoDB

I chose MongoDB because of its schema-less, document-oriented design, which allows for rapid development and flexibility. It is especially useful when dealing with evolving or unstructured data, as it does not require a predefined schema. Its support for JSON-like documents makes it a natural fit for real-time applications where data structure can change over time.

## Schema-less Structure

- MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-likedocuments, allowing fields to vary across documents and enabling quick iterations without complex migrations.

## High Performance

- MongoDB is optimized for **read/write speed**.

## Scalability

- Can handle **big data** and high-volume traffic with ease.
